# Support for Hypatia

Thank you for helping us improve Hypatia and being part of our community!
All Hypatia projects use GitHub Issues to track both bugs and feature requests.
Please, take a moment to read through the following guidelines.

## Guidelines for Filing Issues

### 1. Search Existing Issues

Before filing a new issue:

- Browse or search through the existing issues in the appropriate repository.
- Ensure that your issue has not already been reported or addressed.

This helps avoid duplicates and keeps the issue tracker clean and organised.

### 2. File a New Issue

If your issue has not been reported yet:

- Create a new issue in the relevant repository.
- Clearly describe your bug or feature request.
  In particular, include:
  - Steps to reproduce the bugs;
  - Use cases or benefits for the new features;
  - Relevant documents, logs, links, etc.
