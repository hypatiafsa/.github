# Support for Hypatia

All Hypatia projects use GitHub Issues to track bugs and feature requests.

- **Search Existing Issues:**
Before filing a new issue, please search the existing issues to ensure it has
not already been reported.
This helps reduce duplicates and keeps the issue tracker clean.

- **File a New Issue:**
For all new issues, file your bug or feature request as a new Issue in the
appropriate repository.

Thank you for helping us improve Hypatia!
