# Support for Hypatia

Thank you for helping us improve Hypatia and being part of our small community!
Your feedback is invaluable and we appreciate your contributions.
All Hypatia projects use **GitHub Issues** to track **documentation issues**,
**code bugs**, and **feature requests**.
Please, take a moment to read through the following guidelines.

## Guidelines for Filing Issues

### 1. Check for Existing Issues

Before filing a new issue:

- Browse or search through the existing issues in the appropriate repository.
- Ensure that your issue has not already been reported or addressed.

This helps avoid duplicates and keeps the issue tracker clean and organised.

### 2. File a New Issue

If your issue has not been reported yet:

- Create a new issue in the relevant repository and category.
- Clearly describe your documentation error, code bug, or feature request.
  In particular, include:
  - Location of the error in the documentation;
  - Steps to reproduce the code bugs;
  - Use cases or benefits for the new features;
  - Corrections whenever possible;
  - Relevant documents, logs, links, etc.
